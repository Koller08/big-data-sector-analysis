Hey there.  The instructions are fairly straight forward to replicate our study.  We found Big Data on kaggle linked here https://www.kaggle.com/naveedhn/amazon-product-review-spam-and-non-spam and used the electronics file, uploading it to an S3 bucket on AWS.  Then we used pyspark in SageMaker to run a fake review and LDA analysis.  Code for that is back on the main page under project scripts.  For the non technical crowd a nice resource we found to help getting SageMaker up and running can be found at this link: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-amazon-sagemaker-notebooks-backed-by-spark-in-amazon-emr/.  Once this step was covered, we imported our analysis files into Amazon QuickSight for visualization.  Yuzy's demonstration in our presentation video briefly goes over this.  And that's all there is to it.  Let us know if you have any questions!
