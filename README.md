# big-data-sector-analysis

**Introduction:**

As we all know, Big Data is a hot topic in the world today.  From customer experience optimization engines at Netfilx to stunningly accurate weather prediction technology on windows, its applications can be found anywhere.  What we aim to show viewers in this project is a sequential solution to a common problem that every business is facing today, which is what to do with all this data?  This is an important issue to solve, because business insights found through big data can be taken advantage of leading ultimately to a better customer experience and more profit for companies.  An ideal solution should satisfy these requirements:
  1) Store big data in an environment that is secure, manageable, scalable, and can hold a ton of data all at an affordable price
  2) Once the data is stored there must be a way to derive insights from state of the art, easy to use build, train, & deployment machine learning processes
  3) Now that insights are derived, there has to be a platform to deliver them in an easy to understand way
Luckily, there are world leading companies that tackle these very problems and they do it well.  To solve the first problem about storage, AWS's S3 simple storage system is the premier cloud storage and mangement platform.  For problem number two, once its stored how to analyze, AWS's SageMaker is the ideal candidate to pair with S3 to build, train, and deploy state of the art machine learning solutions.  And finally, to visualize, AWS's QuickSight visualization platform offers an easy to understand user interface able to pull insights from multiple data sources available including easy integration with AWS, third party data, spreadsheet data, SaaS data, business to business data, and much more.  We have created a flyer and short video describing the benefits of this solution along with providing a small use case which we did ourselves revolving around a low cost, real-time sector performance monitoring solution using these tools. The flyer and video link are provided below.
